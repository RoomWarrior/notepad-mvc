<h1>Navigating through a Document</h1>
<p>
As a document gets longer, it gets harder and harder to
navigate through it. For example, if you were working on
a 1000-line novel, how would you get to the very end of
the document or to page 100?.

Scroll bars
The scroll bars are the most basic way to move between
line in a document. The vertical scroll bar is located
along the right side of the window and is used to move up
and down in a document. The horizontal scroll bar is
located along the bottom of the window, and is used to
move from left to right when a document doesnâ€™t fit
entirely on the screen (Figure_11).
